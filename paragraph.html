		<p style="color:white;font-family:arial" align="center">Josuke Higashikata (東方 仗助 Higashikata Jōsuke) is the main protagonist of the fourth part of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, Diamond is Unbreakable, and the fourth JoJo of the series.
		He is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and Tomoko Higashikata. He also appears as one of the main protagonists in the spin-off manga Crazy Diamond's Demonic Heartbreak and the light novel Crazy Heartbreakers. Josuke is a biracial (half-Japanese and half-British) first-year high school student residing in the town of Morioh.
		In the year 1999, he meets Jotaro Kujo, who informs him that he is Joseph's illegitimate son, making him a descendant of the Joestar Family.
		After his grandfather dies, Josuke takes it upon himself to protect his beloved town from malevolent Stand users.
		Josuke is a Stand user that wields Crazy Diamond, a Stand with the power to repair almost anything.</p>
		<p style="color:white;font-family:arial" align="center">Josuke is a tall, young man of average build.
			His most prominent feature is his well-maintained pompadour with two small, curved spikes in the back, styled after that of an unknown man who saved his life as a child.
			His pompadour has a tendency to become spiky with his mood, such as when he is irritated or angry.
			Josuke wears a dark, modified Japanese school uniform. His jacket conforms to his body, extending to the middle of his thigh, accompanied by a pair of wide-legged pants.
			He keeps his jacket unbuttoned and pinned aside, revealing a light undershirt with a short zipper on each side of his chest.
			He also wears a small stud in each ear.
			Josuke wears a number of metallic/golden emblems.
			On the left side of his collar, he wears a modified anchor and on his right, a row of two small hearts.
			Pinning his open jacket to his chest on his right is a peace sign (☮), and on the left is a heart (occasionally enclosing a palm, like on Jotaro's hat).
			He wears a gold band at both wrists over his sleeves (under more elaborate pieces in several illustrations).
			A man with expensive taste, Josuke wears Mr. Junko original socks, ¥25,000 black Bally shoes, and Moschino brand underwear.</p>
		<p style="color:white;font-family:arial" align="center">At first impression, strangers are often intimidated by Josuke's delinquent appearance and hotheadedness, with Jotaro Kujo and Koichi Hirose both thinking Josuke was "scary" when they initially encountered him.
			Indeed, his "delinquent" attitude is conveyed through his rough language; he does not always display the deference towards adults and authority figures typically expected of a Japanese teenager, opting for a casual and straightforward tone.
			However, it is immediately apparent that Josuke has a deep capacity for kindness, with his anger simply being an extension of his tendency to display emotions openly and passionately.
			His outgoing and friendly nature allows him to befriend many Stand users over the course of the story, converting enemies into allies.
			These bonds strengthen his resolve to protect the town of Morioh and the people he loves.</p>
		<p style="color:white;font-family:arial" align="center">Josuke's empathy is clearly manifested in his Stand, which has the ability to heal people and repair objects to a previous state.
			Already using his Stand to heal people and fixing broken bones as a young child, Josuke doesn't like to see people in pain.
			Because he was always able to "fix" people, he has difficulty accepting death as a permanent state that his Stand cannot change.
			For example, when he finds his grandfather dead, Josuke heals the wounds on his corpse and insists he is going to wake up fine, unable to accept his death as a reality until Jotaro gently tells him that no Stand can bring the dead back to life.
			This has a profound effect on Josuke, who begins to see life as something even more worthy of protecting.
			Josuke will also go to great lengths to heal acquaintances or even enemies; during the Nijimura Brothers arc, he risks his life and sustains injuries to heal a severely wounded Okuyasu, even though he tried to kill Josuke moments ealier.
			His reasoning was "I just don't want anyone to die."</p>
		<p style="color:white;font-family:arial" align="center">Overall, Josuke behaves like a teenager and, aside from his general goal of protecting Morioh from any Stand menace, is concerned by more down to earth matters, such as hanging out with his friends.
			As a result, Josuke is almost never seen alone in the streets of Morioh.
			Josuke passively protects his town, and only acts when directly asked by the much more proactive Jotaro or when he directly encounters a Stand user.
			Curious, Josuke is quick to investigate any unusual phenomenon, which often leads him to a Stand user.</p>
		<p style="color:white;font-family:arial" align="center">Sufficiently humble, Josuke confesses to being nervous around famous people, opting not to go with Koichi to first meet Rohan Kishibe due to his great fame as a mangaka.
			Josuke also has a fear of turtles, and has tried to touch a turtle to get rid of that fear.
			Josuke isn't shy to admit his limits, and has confessed that he doesn't know much about manga, or isn't good at video games, even though he isn't happy to have someone know these factoids.
			In the same way, Josuke tries to live up to Jotaro, whom he admires, and has been nervous around him due to a fear of not living up to the task Jotaro entrusted to him.
			He has also shown a mild fear of ghosts (in the beginning), as shown when Koichi wonders if he saw a ghost in the house next to Josuke's, and Josuke nervously tells him to cut it out.
			Josuke is very prone to openly communicate his feelings and emotions, making him appear to be a goofy individual.</p>
		<p style="color:white;font-family:arial" align="center">However, in a fight, Josuke is much more calm and observational, even though aspects of his goofiness tend to shine through.
			He has sufficient confidence in his own abilities, namely his Stand, but this doesn't extend to Josuke himself since he can still be nervous if things don't go his way.
			Additionally, Terunosuke Miyamoto observes that Josuke's nervous tic is to bite his lips.
			Even if Josuke is gentle by nature, he has no qualms about brutalizing an enemy and, in the case that someone has hurt or endangered a loved one, Josuke will be even more vindictive, as he fused Angelo with a rock and Terunosuke with a book.</p>
		<p style="color:white;font-family:arial" align="center">Having inherited his father's mischievous side, Josuke has no qualms bending any established rules or even breaking the law over his greedy pursuits.
			When he and Okuyasu meet Shigechi, Josuke uses his cleverness and charisma to exploit Shigechi's Stand Harvest to find discarded change and coupons from all over Morioh, and commits a felony by impersonating the original buyer of a winning lottery ticket in order to redeem the money.
			Similarly, after meeting Mikitaka Hazekura, he takes advantage of his shape-shifting ability, convincing Mikitaka to turn into dice in order to cheat money from Rohan, with whom he has a bad relationship.
			Josuke also steals Joseph's wallet as he departs Morioh, with Josuke cheekily referring to it as his "allowance".</p>
		<p style="color:white;font-family:arial" align="center">While Josuke does have his fair share of groupies, he deals with them much less dramatically than his father and nephew.
			He isn't perverted nor relentlessly flirtatious (unlike Joseph), but he doesn't go out of his way to get rid of them (unlike Jotaro).
			Instead, if the girls near Josuke express interest in him, he is flattered and has shown to get along quite well with his female classmates and admirers.
			When Jotaro asks Josuke to go hunting, Josuke initially believes he means hunting for girls and says with a blush and smile that he is more of a 'love kind of guy'.
			He is also humorously noted to be jealous of Yuya Fungami's groupies.
			However, he seems to be willing to fight them as he threatened to kill Yukako if she tried to do anything to Koichi, with whom she was obsessed.</p>
		<p style="color:white;font-family:arial" align="center">As a catchphrase, Josuke often says "Great" in English.
			He also displays an odd quirk whenever he pronounces the Japanese phrase kakkoii (かっこいい), a masculine compliment essentially meaning "cool", where he will always pronounce it weirdly like "Kappyoii" or "Kacchoii."
			These mispronunciations are translated as "kewl" in the English Crunchyroll subtitles.</p>
		<p style="color:white;font-family:arial" align="center">Josuke is hyper-sensitive about his unique hairstyle, reacting violently to anyone that mocks it.
			Koichi believes this idiosyncrasy is due to Josuke treating it as an insult to his childhood savior that he modeled his own style upon.
			Josuke automatically enters a blind rage, regardless of the circumstances, and doesn't hesitate to attack people he may have deferred to moments earlier, such as an upperclassman that was bullying him.
			This "blind rage" is also literal; when Rohan Kishibe openly mocks Josuke's hair in an attempt to manipulate him into looking at his manuscript, Josuke is so enraged that he cannot see it right in front of him, and beats Rohan so severely that he is sent to the hospital and forced to put his manga on hiatus for two months.</p>
		<p style="color:white;font-family:arial" align="center">Araki explains that Josuke was truly hurt by the fact that he grew up never knowing his father and that he covered up this pain with the pompadour man who saved him as a kid.
			According to Araki, Josuke considers that man a hero, somebody he can rely on, and a symbol of his faith in people.</p>
