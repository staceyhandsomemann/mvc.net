				text-align: justify;
				font-family: Arial;">
				This is British Racing Green written in RGB Code (0, 66, 37).
				The name is self explanatory.
				This color was, and still is, used by most british racing teams like Bentley and their 4Â½ Litre, or Jaguar with their D-Type.
				Car manufacturers also use this as a factory option car color like Aston Martin with their Vantage (also appeared with their F1 Safety car).</h3>

		<h3 style="background-color:rgb(228,100,0);
				color:black;
				text-align: justify;

				color:#ffe217;
				text-align: justify;
				font-family: Arial;">
				This is Subaru's official colors written in hex color codes (#0e4bef, and #ffe217).
				Subaru used these colors when Group B Rally Racing was still alive and well (specifically their World Rally Team). 
				They used these in their very iconic 555 Subaru 22B, but when their sponsorship with 555 ended, they just went with the colors and used it as their official colors for their WRC Team.
				To this day, it's still in use.</h3>

		<h3 style="background-color:yellow;
				color:black;
				text-align: justify;
				font-family: Arial;">
				This is Chevy's (Chevrolet) official color for the Camaro written with a predefined color name "yellow" (looked up the hex code for the color and somehow the predefined color and the hex code itself somehow matches, i'm blind so it probably doesn't match in your eyes).
				The movie "Transformers" had a robot named "Bumblebee" that popularized the now-iconic Yellow Camaro with the black stripes at the middle.</h3>

				text-align: justify;

				This is Dodge's FC7 Plum Crazy Purple written in hsl color codes (hue, saturation, lightness, 250, 47%, 40%). It appeared in most mopar vehicles, mostly Dodge cars like the Super Bee, Challenger, and the Dart Swinger. It is by far one of the most iconic color Dodge
				has ever put in their cars because not only does purple mean royalty, it also looks very... "Demon-y" (yes that's a pun, a play on their Dodge Demon).</h3>
