		<p style="background-color:white;font-family:arial">When I was a teeny tiny boy, we had a family computer. It had a Windows 7 OS and I mostly just played those offline games pre-packaged with the OS itself like "Purble Place" and "Solitaire" though I didn't know how to play it. Many years of playing around with the family computer and I've built up an interest in computers and anything about them, and I wanted to expand my knowledge to it as well cause I know that the power of a computer is limitless.</p>
